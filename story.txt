Kyle went to go pick-up his pc from the repair shop when BRATWURSTS started to fall from the sky.
He did not know when he would be back since he went all the way to BERLIN to get it.
Trying to dodge the sausages raining from the sky, he ran into a nearby RATSKELLER. 
He was feeling overwhelmed so he ate the DAJNER in his pocket.
